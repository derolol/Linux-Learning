## 1. 文件操作

+ 系统I/O操作 -> provide by OS

  + with no buffer, base on file describtion
  + device file and simple file
  + e.g. open write

+ standard I/O operation -> base on system I/O

  + with buffer, base on file stream
  + cannot deal with device file
  + e.g. fopen fread

## 2. Buffer

+ Buffer is important and demand the speed of running

+ Buffer Kind
  + single buffer T+M+C
  + double buffer T+MAX(T, M+C)
  + circle buffer T==M+C

+ Buffer Type

  + No buffer - 1B
    + Relate: write, read
  + Line buffer
    + Relate: printf()
    + Flag: `\r\n`
    + >1 && <1024B
  + OS buffer - 1024B
    + Relate: fread, fwrite, outside device

> When meet the condition of buffer full which mean overflow, system run one I/Ooperation
